Ensuring access to notarized metadata

There are several mechanisms we directly foresee being used for incentivization feedback loops based around the metadata measurements of entities in the filecoin ecosystem. For instance, reports of miner behavior can be used by reputation systems ranking miners, which then are used by clients to select higher quality miners near them. This data doesn’t make sense to directly embed within the filecoin chain for a few reasons: It is produced by independent entities, so the data itself does not need to meet the same ‘consensus’ bar as what we would expect in a global chain, and likewise aspects of reputation and measurements may have aspects of subjectivity. It is also expected that there is diversity of data and that experimentation is a good thing.
However, there are nice properties of having this sort of metadata ecosystem more tightly linked to the chain that seem desirable to encourage, and this leads to the goals for the sidechain metadata service:

* Keep included metadata consistently available
* Provide light-weight, unbiased access to metadata
* Discourage historical revisionism.
